          <p>I am Shubham Majumdar and I am a Test Automation Engineer at Holland America.I got my MS degree in Electrical and Electronics Engineering from CSULA in Fall 2011.I have been working in IT as a Test Engineer for over 6 years and am passionate about technology.I am really humbled to be a student at Code Fellows and hope to gain enough knowledge and experience to have a smooth transition into becoming backend developer. </p>

          <p>Hello, my name is Bree Long and I am a software developer! I have over 10 years in the financial institution industry, and my role for the past 3 years is a project manager/systems analyst. My background has lead me to pursue coding because my part of my job is to be a subject matter expert in the enterprise-wide systems, and knowing the code behind the experience is the only missing piece to the puzzle. Once my puzzle is completed, I want to move on to building things myself, and put that skill towards helping charities and non-profits have a greater digital footprint. I currently volunteer at an animal rescue in Puyallup and would love to help develop their site to make it easier to adopt!
