          <p>I am James. I am in engineering field, where I deal with maintenance, servicing and installing machines on daily basis. I used to sometimes come across to the PCs and other IT equipments and I have always amazed with how computers work, wondering myself how they can run and perform different set of orders. I knew it is through software applications, but I always asked myself what software is? how and what it is made from? How it makes the computer run and control other peripherals connected to it? Unable to find answers to those questions, and after realizing that even people in the field were providing more confusing than clear answers, I decided to learn coding as a way to find answers. Coming to Code Fellows was a gate to opportunities of getting answers to what I have been asking myself: how softwares are made (written), that they are set of instructions that make computers run and execute different tasks, from simple to complex ones. And Yes, I am still very excited to go deeper and learn more!
            My technical education and experience backgrounds helped me to understand fast what really is happening with computers: Being familiar with microcontrollers, microprocessors and PLCs, which are like micro computers used to run and control processes and machines operations, by using a set of instructions (programs) written into their memories that enable them to interact with machines that they control, I found out that computers were not very far from them, but how programs/codes were developed and written into their memories was an unknown zone to me.
            As a software developer, so far I know now what really is going on into those microchips and computers memories. My next task is to integrate my knowledge into practical use and become good at writing useful programs mostly for computers, including PLC programs as well!
