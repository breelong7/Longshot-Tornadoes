                <li class="strengths">Communication. Our team stayed in contact through our own private slack channel. We spoke every day about what we are working on, any blocks or difficulties we were experiencing, and oustanding pull requests that were ready to be merged.</li>
                <li class="strengths">Ownership. By identifying each team member's individual strengths, we were able to boost productivity and create a space where everyone was engaged and did their fair share of work.</li>
                <li class="strengths">Support. Any time a team member was getting stuck or just needed an idea to bounce off of someone, most, if not all team members would jump in and be available to help even outside of our scheduled project days.</li>
                <li class="strengths">Clear goals. One of our first discussions as a team was what we wanted to focus our project on. Together, we decided on a clear goal to achieve MVP and stuck to it. We were able to quickly make progress because we were all working towards the same outcome.</li>
                <li class="list-top">-Opportunities-</li>
                <li class="ops">Risk. We played it safe and could have incorporated a bit more risk into our project.</li>
                <li class="ops">Retrospective. It may have been helpful to have team discussions on what we are doing well, what we can improve on, and what we should start/stop doing actively throughout working on our project.</li>
                <li  id="last" class="ops">Inconsistent code. Some team members were having issues pulling the most current code from our repo and viewing our site in the web browser.</li>
