A website that will take the user through prompts to use logic decide what type of drink will quench their thirst based on their input (Buzzfeed quiz style). Present one drink recommendation back to the user.

## Communication plan

Our main channel of communication is a group chat on Slack.

As needed - download Teamviewer to collaborate remotely. Teamviewer is a software tool that allows us to share screens


## Team Rules

1.	Do not merge your own code

## Working Session Summaries

### 9/23/2019 - 
Group members assigned, team name picked, and got started right away on our project MVP as well as group dynamic. Very productive session. We were all able put the team above individuals and have a collaborative discussion to make decisions based on what's best for everyone. See Github project board for action items.


## Wins, Blocks, Significant Events

9/23/2019 - Our first group session was a win! The team was very open, everyone felt safe to speak up and give their thoughts even if it was different. I feel like we did a great job of forming our MVP based on each team member's feedback.
